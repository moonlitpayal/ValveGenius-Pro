## 🧘‍♂️ The Vibe: "Coding in Fugue State"

**I didn't just "build" this.** I entered a state of flow where the requirements for Artee Flow Controls—managing 5000+ clients, tracking Exisol valves, automating quotes—transcended into code. 

There was no trial and error. Just pure output. 
This dashboard is the result of **vibe coding**: intuitive, rapid, and flawlessly aligned with business impact.

## 🧠 The "Why"

**Artee Flow Controls** is scaling from ₹130Cr to ₹1000Cr. They don't need "software"; they need **velocity**.

* **Problem:** Manual quoting is slow.
* **My Fix:** An AI engine that reads specs and spits out PDF quotes.
* **Problem:** Field engineers can't see the product.
* **My Fix:** A 3D AR module that puts the valve in their hand (virtually).

## 🛠️ The Stack (The Tools of Flow)

* **Engine:** React 18 + Vite (Instant HMR)
* **Style:** Tailwind CSS (Styled at the speed of thought)
* **Motion:** Framer Motion (Because UI should feel alive)
* **Brain:** Gemini AI (For intelligent context)
