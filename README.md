## 🧘‍♂️ The Vibe: "Coding in Fugue State"

**I didn't just "build" this.** I entered a state of flow where the requirements for Artee Flow Controls—managing 5000+ clients, tracking Exisol valves, automating quotes—transcended into code.

There was no trial and error. Just pure output. This dashboard is the result of **vibe coding**: intuitive, rapid, and flawlessly aligned with business impact.

### 🎯 The Mission: 130Cr → 1000Cr
*A visual manifesto of Artee's growth trajectory, powered by intelligent automation.*

## 🎥 The 58-Minute Result (In Action)

*Watch the AI generate a ₹50 Lakh quote in under 3 seconds. This is the speed of modern sales.*

## 🧠 The "Why" & The Solution

**Artee Flow Controls** is scaling fast. They don't need "software"; they need **velocity**.

* **Problem:** Manual quoting is slow and prone to error.
* **My Fix:** An **AI Quote Engine** that reads specs and spits out PDF quotes instantly.
* **Problem:** Field engineers can't visualize complex products on-site.
* **My Fix:** A **3D AR Module** that puts the valve in their hand (virtually) before they order.
* **Problem:** Inventory visibility is fragmented.
* **My Fix:** A **Live Inventory Dashboard** with real-time stock, pressure ratings, and certifications.

## 📸 The Engineering Interface

### 1. Live Inventory Command Center
*Real-time tracking of 50+ valve SKUs, including Exisol Gate, Ball, and Butterfly valves. Engineers can filter by pressure (150-2500 PSI) and ATEX certification instantly.*

### 2. AI Quote Engine & Revenue Projector
*The heart of the sales acceleration. Select a client and product, and the system calculates a total price, generates a PDF quote, and projects the revenue impact based on current sales velocity.*

### 3. Zone-1 Hazard Simulator & 3D AR Preview
*Safety and visualization tools for field engineers. The simulator auto-flags high-risk installations, while the 3D view allows for detailed inspection of complex DN600 valves before ordering.*
